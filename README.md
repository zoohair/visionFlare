This is source code in Matlab which implements a pipeline for runway edge detection, and uses it to predict above ground altitude.

This work was done as part of coursework for the [CS231A vision course](http://cs231a.stanford.edu) 

Refer to the project [report](docs/more_words.md) for the methodology.

I'd love to see this implemented on a phone some day!
