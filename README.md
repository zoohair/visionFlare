This is source code in Matlab which implements a pipeline for runway edge detection, and uses it to predict above ground altitude.
 
The entry file is [processVideo.m](processVideo.m). It works on the file data/test1.avi and uses data/test.bkgnd.png as a mask.
Refer to the project [report](report/report.pdf) for the methodology.


This work was done as part of coursework for the [CS231A vision course](http://cs231a.stanford.edu) 


I'd love to see this implemented on a phone some day!
