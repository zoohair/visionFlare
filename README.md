This is source code in Matlab which implements a pipeline for runway edge detection, and uses it to predict above ground altitude. Refer to the project [report](report/report.pdf) for the methodology. A beamer  [presentation](report/project_presentation.pdf) is also included.

 
The entry file is [processVideo.m](processVideo.m). It processes the video file [data/test1.avi](data/test1.avi) and uses [data/test.bkgnd.png](data/test.bkgnd.png) as a mask.

Sample processed results are available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWjFQfFFzrY).

This work was done as part of coursework for the [CS231A vision course](http://cs231a.stanford.edu) 


I'd love to see this implemented on a phone some day!
